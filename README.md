## Introduction

For this coding challenge I chose a stack I'm familiar with, and use regularly. The structure is a simplified version of the scaffolding I usually apply to a React project, with just the necessary parts - `components`, `hooks` and `pages` (plus some basic theming & types).

The backend is a single serverless function, whos main benefit is to hide the authentication token from the public.

For the frontend I wanted to do something a little fancy without going too far outside of the requirements, and trying to keep the LOC to a minimum. The UX is probably not the _best_ for a quick search app, but I had to add **some** transitions ü§ì.

In regards to state management, to keep the complexity low (and because I didn't feel the project really warranted it) I simply used React state, rather than something like React context or Redux.

Additionally for number formatting (dates & prices) I took a similar approach, using modern browser APIs, as opposed to third-party libraries.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Although the challenge mentioned to use the **2nd of August 2021** as the date, since this is in the past I've used a future date.
